# LOUIS_CK_TOUR

Louis C.K., one of my favorite stand-up comedians, is finally performing in Hong Kong as part of his Ridiculous tour, with the show scheduled for March 24, 2026. According to his website, tickets will go on sale sometime in August 2025—but the exact date hasn’t been announced yet.

The purpose of louis_ck_tour is to monitor his website regularly and notify me as soon as the ticket sale date is posted. When an update is detected, the program sends a ntfy message to the topic louis_ck_hk_tour.
